\chapter{Conclusions}

Through LEED and AES measurments a successfull preperation of both studied substrates could be validated.
Even though there could not be found a commensurate super-lattice for the 1ML coverage of ZnTPP on Cu(100), the sharp spots clearly show an ordered assembly of the molecules.
The momentum map at fermi energy as well as the main bands in the bandstructure of the Fe(100)-\textit{p}(1\times1)O sample are comparible to literature, only the features around the $\overline{\Upgamma}$ point at the fermi level could not be reproduced.
In all

-erfolgreiche preparation
-Ã¤hnliche bandstruktur aber unterschiede 
features an gamma gar nicht sichtbar
-momentum maps zu wenig statistik um moleculare features in den maps zu sehen 
-trotzdem in winkelintegrierten spektren features sichtbar und zuordbar
-workfunktion
