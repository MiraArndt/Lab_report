\chapter{Results}

Here, the results of the data analysis should be reported in a concise way. The data should be
properly analyzed and compared with the literature, highlighting similarities, as well as
differences, with other works. There is not need for too many figures, the idea is trying to
summarize the main data that you want to show in few images and “condensate” the
information. For the report between 5 to 10 figures are ok.
